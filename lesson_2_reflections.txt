What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The repository starts tracking the changes that take place in it. This is necessary so that the progress and changes to a file(s) can be tracked in an organizational way.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary place between the working directory and the repository and provides a separate place to track what files are being committed to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area shows you what you are about to commit so that you can see which files will be included in the commit and make sure that they should all be a part of the commit.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams show me how to understand the relationships between various commits and how branches separate out features of each commit and how versions of code can come about and be maintained separately.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

The historical changes made to the two branches are combined into one single historical record.
