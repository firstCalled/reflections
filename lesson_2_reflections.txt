What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

The repository starts tracking the changes that take place in it. This is necessary so that the progress and changes to a file(s) can be tracked in an organizational way.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediary place between the working directory and the repository and provides a separate place to track what files are being committed to the repository.
